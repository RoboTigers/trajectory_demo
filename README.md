This repository contains an interactive demonstration for calculating the optimal shooting angle for a given ball velocity in the [FIRST Robotics Competition 2016 Stronghold](http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/welcome-to-first-stronghold) game. It includes calculations with and without wind resistance.

You can interactively run the notebook [on Binder](http://mybinder.org/repo/RoboTigers/trajectory_demo/Projectiles.ipynb). Just click "Cell > Run All", then scroll to the bottom, where you can adjust the sliders to change the ball velocity, robot position and portion of the goal you are aiming for.
